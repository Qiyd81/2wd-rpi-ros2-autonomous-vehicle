# 2WD Raspberry Pi Autonomous Vehicle running ROS2 Foxy
ROS2 Foxy - installed via Ubuntu server 20.04 - is employed in controlling a 2 wheeled drive vehicle. An RPLIDAR A1 sensor is used for obstacle avoidance and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) operations. The vehicle is powered by Raspberry Pi 4 board computer. For added functionality, the vehicle can be controlled with a joystick game controller.
